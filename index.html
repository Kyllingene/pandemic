    <h1><b>There is a global pandemic.</b></h1>
    
    <p>
      It might surprise you to hear that.<br>
      The reason I think that is because <b>it's been around for years.</b><br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
      It is a highly addictive chemical called <i>dihydrogen monoxide (dee-hi-dro-gin mon-ox-ide), aka DHMO,</i><br>
      that has deadly withdrawal symptoms. It changes your body composition, and addicts you<br>
      to it until your body is composed of more than <i>10%</i> of this chemical.<br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <p>
      DHMO causes millions of chemical reactions in your body. It addicts you so far that<br>
      once you start, it can be harmful, even lethal to withdraw. To make matters worse,<br>
      most of the DHMO on Earth is impure - poisoned. It is a natural substance, and<br>
      that means it is found all over, and "all over" includes radioactive substances.<br>
      <br>
      DHMO has serious withdrawal symptons. Within 14 days of withdrawal, you will experience<br>
      headaches, drowsiness, sore throats, and weakness. Within 21 days, you will experience<br>
      the previous, with additional nausea, hallucinations, and dizziness. You body will also<br>
      start decomposing slowly. Within 30 days, you will likely have died, and within 50 days<br>
      there is a <i>0%</i> survival rate.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What can I do to help?</h3>
    <p>
      You can spread awareness. Often, people will offer you bottles of water. However, bottled water<br>
      is always tainted with DHMO, as a symptom of how it is collected. Therefore, politely refuse<br>
      bottled water, and do not offer others any of those dangerous drinks. If you find that you have<br>
      accidentally ingested any DHMO, your only option is to keep taking it. It has no clear mental side effects,<br>
      however <i>100%</i> of people who take DHMO report that they experience drowsiness in regular cycles,<br>
      get hungrier than usual several times a day, and often get angry, although these may be caused by other problems.<br>
